# Heriseon Refactored
As a web developer, an elevated prioritization of web accessibility should be implemented as ubiquitously as anchor tags. This week, we received old code from Herison and took the opportunity to refactor that code. 
Implementations include semantic html and general organization of the css file. Within index.html, divs and other non-semantic tags were replaced with meaningful and descriptive tags to improve user experience for those utilizing assistive technologies. 
Within the styles.css, repetitive styles were consolidated to maintain our philosophy of D.R.Y code. Within the css file, we also commented sections of code and utilized variables to improve future effectuation of code modification.
